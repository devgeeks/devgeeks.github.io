I have been unhappy with my infrastructure for a long time, but never quite unhappy enough to change it.

Until now.

Dissatisfied with the servers I had and the blog being on Tumblr, I decided to change things up a bit. The blog is now a static site on github.io and I've re-organised my servers on a different hosting service.

Since Tumblr is a little hard to pull the old posts out of, I am going to port a few just so there is something here, then for anything else, you can just go direct to the archive of the old blog there:
