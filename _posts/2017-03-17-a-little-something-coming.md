I know this blog has been a ghost town, but my work on the PhoneGap team at Adobe has keep me plenty busy.

However, I am working on something cool that I am hoping to blog about on here soon.<!--break--> It’s basically a replacement for Crypton (the lib used in Encryptr for private app storage). It should be a great deal faster and simpler to use / set up.

Anyway, with SpiderOak giving up on Crypton, it seemed like a good time to implement some ideas David Dahl and I had at the time Encryptr was being developed.

Stay tuned?
